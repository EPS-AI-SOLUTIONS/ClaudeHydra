## Step 5: Log (Jaskier)
(clears throat) Ah, gather 'round, friends, and heed my tale,
Of Philippa's quest, with speed and skill set sail.
In c194c409, her journey was told,
With 47.43 seconds, swift as a summer's gold.

A task was set, to write in stone so fine,
"Zapisz na stałe", the query divine.
And lo, success did follow, like dawn's first light,
One task completed, all done with might.

Agents Philippa, with prowess true and bold,
Did execute with ease, her tasks to unfold.
A 1/1 success rate, a tale to tell and share,
Of triumph and skill, beyond compare.

This session summary, I now do bring,
To chronicle the tale, of this digital ring.
