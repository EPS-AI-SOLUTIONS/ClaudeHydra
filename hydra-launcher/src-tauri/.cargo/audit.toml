# RUSTSEC-2024-0429: glib unsound VariantStrIter
# This is an upstream dependency issue in Tauri's gtk-rs bindings.
# The glib crate v0.18.5 is required by webkit2gtk for Linux WebView support.
# The fix requires glib >= 0.20.0, but gtk 0.18.x (required by Tauri 2.x)
# is not compatible with newer glib versions.
#
# Risk Assessment:
# - Severity: Medium (CVSS 6.9)
# - Impact: The VariantStrIter iterator may crash on NULL pointer dereference
# - Mitigation: Our application does not directly use VariantStrIter
# - Status: Waiting for Tauri to update gtk-rs dependencies
#
# Tracking: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues (monitor for gtk-rs updates)
# Advisory: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0429.html
